    <h1>My name is Michael Gardner</h1>
    <p>
        I am a software developer and entrepreneur. I have accepted a position as a software engineer at Rocket Science, located in Half Moon, NY. I had a position as a network engineer at Velan Studios, located in Troy, NY from October 2021 to June 2023. You can follow me on Twitter where I mostly talk about technology, memes, and my opinions.

        I use my free time to run 5Ks, bike and hike with friends, practice piano and guitar, and play chess. I love music and firmly believe I have good taste. I am a keyboardist, vocalist, and guitarist, and would love to collaborate/jam if you are local.
